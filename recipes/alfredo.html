    <p>All about my dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>The Chicken</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2lbs of Chicken Breast</strong>-Thinly Sliced or Butterflied</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Pepper</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Paprika</strong></li>
        <li> <strong>Onion Powder</strong></li>
        <li> <strong>Garlic Powder</strong></li>
        <li> <strong>2Tbsp. Olive Oil</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Pasta</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1lb Pasta Noodles of Choice</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 Stick Garlic Butter</strong></li>
        <li><strong>8oz. Heavy Whipping Cream</strong></li>
        <li><strong>8oz. Garlic and Herb Cream Cheese</strong></li>
        <li><strong>8oz. Parmesan Cheese</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2Tbsp. Ricotta Cheese</strong> &lpar;optional&rpar;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by trimming and butterflying chicken breast if it isn't pre trimmed and cut. This step in not absolutely necessary, more personal preference. It makes it easier to cook evenly and help avoid any strange textures in your chicken.</li>
        <li>Begin seasoning your chicken generously. I always start with pinches of each seasoning. Sprinkle on each side so it's well covered. This part is also personal preference, wherein, if you enjoy a lot, load it on. If you don't, season lightly. And if you're unsure start with 1Tbsp. of paprika, &frac12;Tbsp. onion powder, and garlic poweder, and &frac14;tsp. salt and paper. Mix all of this together and sprinkle on both sides of your chicken. Don't forget to press the seasonings into your chicken.</li>
        <li>In a large pan heat 2Tbsp. of olive oil. Place the Chicken on medium high heat. Allow to cook for 6 minutes before flipping and cooking on the other side. Wrap in foil and allow it to rest while you cook the noodles and sauce.</li>
        <lil> Begin boiling your pasta following the instructions on the packaging. I like to cook it about a minute less than it calls for, for a firmer noodle.</lil>
        <li>As you're waiting for your water to boil, melt your stick of butter in a large pan.</li>
        <li>Once your stick is fully melted, add your heavy whipping cream and combine.</li>
        <li>Add your cream cheese and allow it to melt into your cream base.</li>
        <li>By now your noodles should be ready. Drain them and set them off to the side. Add in your parmesan and ricotta cheeses. Once metled add your noodles.</li>
